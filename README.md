Gomiso Python
=============

Minimum xAuth code (no library, "homemade" code) authentification to Gomiso API using xAuth

Purpose
-------
I tried to find documentation with code on how to query xAuth servers.
As I was not able to find something I can use "out of the box", I coded my own version.
I did it without using any library so that you can use it easily

Contributing

Usage
-----
The code is documented and contain a fully self explaining functional example.
The response format should be as follow
oauth_token=rrP1yPkOXXXXXXXXXGNiG&oauth_token_secret=ug1pydN95MvcCuOXXXXXXXXXXDBmkHE4dZxCzjQv

Store the two value for each of your users and use it for each call to the API
